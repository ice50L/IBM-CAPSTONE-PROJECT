# IBM-CAPSTONE-PROJECT

## Background
The project is aimed at finding the most commonly used programming/database/webframe languages in 2019 as well as 2020. The data was taken from the Stack Overflow yearly survey to developers about the languages they use as well as what they want to learn in the future. The link to all Developer Surveys can be found in this link: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey.

## Findings
The link to the full dashboard can be found here: https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/dashboards/ddf7d781-b5bb-4ef9-883b-b11924a2530a/view/0403de3c19a828de6acfe6e4079c7a0e7932705ae6bb8204d4d07b4906347997a86a4198c87e485d89110c32faee150bc8

- These findings are the current (2019) responses that are provided. Javascript appears to be the most used language amongst the sample of respondents, followed by HTML/CSS, thereby indicating that frontend programming is still very much important. 
- MySQL appears to be the most used database language according to the sample of respondents, followed by Microsoft SQL server, which can indicate the demand of these SQL databases during 2019. 
- Windows and Linux are the most popular platforms of 2019, these seem to be the most preferred platforms for any developer of 2019. 
- Lastly, the most popular WebFrames are jQuery and Angular and are widely perferred by developers.

- These findings are 2019 responses as well, however it is asking developers what they want to learn for the next year (2020). From the barplot provided, it appears that JavaScript and HTML/CSS are not sighted to become less popular for the next year, as they both remain to be the most highly desired languages.
- The next finds indicate that PostgreSQL and MongoDB is sighted to become more popular than the previous year's MySQL and Microsoft SQL server, which can be due to the ease of access and learning curve of PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- Linux is predicted to stay the most desired platform by developers, however Docker is predicted to overtake windows in terms of popularity for the 2020 year. 
- Lastly, React.js exploded in popularity and is sighted to become the most used WebFrame language in 2020.

- The findings for the respondents demographics is quite interesting. It appears that the vast majority of the sample taken are males (93.7%) while females make up only 6.3% of the sample size. This can be a indicator of the gross underrepresentation of women in computer sciences and development. 
- Majority of the respondents are in the United States compared to other countries.
- Most respondents appear to be young developers within their 20s.
- The level of education appears to differ between men and women drastically, however this is most likely due to the major underrepresentation of women in development and respondents.
